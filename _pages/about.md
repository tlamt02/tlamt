Freshly graduated from Biochemistry, I am open to further exploring the world of science by zooming into the nanoscale. Great inventions in the field of biology have deployed intrusments for visualizing biomolecules, from DNA, RNA to proteins, cells and organisms to various organs. This blogspot collects current depiction of biological samples.

Imaging cells with Light Microscope
======
In the Module of PC, I have had the luck to present the topic of Tissue clearing and its application in Neuroimaging. With Light-sheet Microscopy we can easily view a whole 3D brain volume of rodent mice. This insight provides further direction for other researches in the field of Neuroimaging.


Protein X-ray structure
======
After a protein was crystallized successfully, it 3-dimensional structure can be analyzed with a soure of X-ray beam. Information gained from these experiments provides many Biochemists with the correct conformation for their protein of interest. 

Protein structure prediction with Alphafold
------
The usage of Bioinformatics tools has helped us visualized so far inadequate-to-crystallize proteins. This simulation aids scientists in predicting folding structure of any desired protein. 

Molecular docking simulation
------
In the field of molecular dynamic simulation, molecular docking has received many attention in the field. This tool has raised interest for finding out how a molecule docks to its interactive partner.

Protein-protein interaction simulation
------
In silico models have developed possible approach to sorting out possible protein interaction partners.
