I am using Academic Pages on Github Pages template for building my personal website profile.


# Getting Started

1. Think about what to do next
1. Think about possible projects
1. What kind of project do I want to deploy here
1. Effort/Reward curve drawn for project pursuer
1. Structural biology with analysis of protein crystal  
1. 3D volume viewer for microscopy images
1. Molecular dynamics simulation
1. Protein-Protein binding simulation
1. Probably solvent effect
1. Weak interactive forces simulation


## Progress

Should I go all for the projects or should I just deploy one?

1. Starting with depiction of 3D protein structure of CK2
1. Gif of the structure
