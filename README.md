I am using Academic Pages on Github Pages template for building my personal website profile.


# Getting Started

Updated: with stand of 04.10.2024: I am quite shocked that I find myself digging deeper into this domain. It might be nothing for the moment, however, i hope it demonstrates in a way my effort to really portray things as I cross the way. 

And, upgrading the space is just making me sad in a way, having to tear down old structures and build upon the current stand of the things. I think it is quite hard to fully let go of the past, just because you want to observe how you have really grown and actually try to better improve your state in a way. Nonetheless, nothing can be considered as ruins, when it is supposed to be regarded as an archive. Framing things negatively is just not really that necessary, not at all.

ThatÂ´s fine enough for getting too emotional, i think.

##Upgraded CV

1. Structured tailor to industrial needs

##Directional planning

It was quite enjoyable to be able to carry on with traces of the past. However, the gap in current surrounding is harder to bridge when the closer loop is being knotted off. 

1. Structural biology with analysis of protein crystal  
1. 3D volume viewer for microscopy images

1. Vectorization and linear mapping
2. Genetic encoding and expression unpacking

Unpopular opinion about network mapping: It is nice and of course detailed to be able to map out all existing relevance. However, going to the next degree requires insights which are not visible from each nodes, simply because the system is too unpredictable. And it also does not guarantee a secure link. Better to explore shifting edges length or even surround clique nodes with docked-hub. 
3. Threshhold-based conditional oscillation

## Progress

1. Linked Imalilo :XD
1. Tested Git

# Direction  

Actually, if direction translates to network of some sorts, then it might pass to the pattern. Just because, correctly trained label are useful in tagging known locations. In case, other type of information also does translate, that is even better. However, not to underestimate the translational work and the surrounding boundaries to even have a categorization of sort.
